			<h1> Conclusion </h1>

			<p> I hope that the advances I have demonstrated both in this static site and in my attached artifacts demonstrate how I have both learned a great deal about digital communication and rhetoric but also still have a lot to improve on.  I believe this class has better prepared me for future positions in which training for more advanced coding may be necessary, especially as I apply for positions in companies such as Epic Systems.
