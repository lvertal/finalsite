			<p> This course has been, in every sense, an introduction to the rhetoric of digital literacy.  While other classes of mine discuss writing within digital mediums, I had not yet been shown the importance of rhetorical skill and an eye to technical accessibility in the context of coding itself. However, I didn't learn everything I'd have liked to - this is mostly down to a failure on my part to comprehend some of the more intricate aspects of code.  This entire reflection has been written in Sublime Text as html code, not in the DITA format I had hoped to use.  I found it difficult to employ CSS effectively in that context.

			By far one of my most important takeaways has been to look at the online mediums I use not as static features of the digital landscape but as consciously produced artifacts.  Everything displayed has a purpose and can be consciously modified, added, deleted.
