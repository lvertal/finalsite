			<p> This course has been, in every sense, an introduction to the rhetoric of digital literacy.  While other classes of mine discuss writing within digital mediums, I had not yet been shown the importance of rhetorical skill and an eye to technical accessibility in the context of coding itself. However, I didn't learn everything I'd have liked to - this is mostly down to a failure on my part to comprehend some of the more intricate aspects of code.  This entire reflection has been written in Sublime Text as html code, not in the DITA format I had hoped to use.  I found it difficult to employ CSS effectively in that context.

			By far one of my most important takeaways has been to look at the online mediums I use not as static features of the digital landscape but as consciously produced artifacts.  Everything displayed has a purpose and can be consciously modified, added, deleted.  

			I adapted well to formats like DITA but when it came to using the command prompt and CSS I feel like I fell short of my desired goals.  I wanted to learn to employ CSS more dynamically but I struggled when translating my CSS knowledge over the formats like DITA.  Online guides were helpful but only to an extent, I feel if I had more time I would have been able to figure out some more advanced methods.

			This course also helped me get into the mindset of a creator in a healthy way.  A motto I tend to live by is "once you know how something is made to go the way it goes, you can also see how it could have gone differently."  So learning fields like this is a good opportunity for me to look at things I like and don't like about certain mediums and ask, "How would I have done that differently?" For instance, I am much more aware now than I was before of just how lacking some websites are in any conveniences for users with accessibility limitations.  I am also more aware of how accessibility can be baked into underlying systems that other users may not even see such as alt text and the necessary changes that need to be made to make things obvious for users with text-readers.

			My two artifacts should also accomplish much in demonstrating what I have struggled with and what I've learned over the course of this class.
