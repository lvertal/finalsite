			<h1> Artifact 1 </h1>
			<p>
			Firstly I would like to focus on an artifact created in this class, the contribution summarizing the presentation "Accessible Google Docs" via Markdown, <a href=https://danieljcard1.github.io/lavadocs/4662/vertal/>linked here.</a>  Markdown was one of the most straightforwardly easy mediums to use in this class as I had already had familiarity with the basic structure and concept through mediums such as Reddit.

		</p>
		<p>

			The assignment itself helped me comprehend various aspects of using not only google docs but a variety of mediums of digital communication.  I especially found the advice regarding explicating links and alt text useful in other classes as well where group projects necessitated accessible content.
		</p>
		<p>

			However it is clear in this deliverable that I am constrained both by my inexperience and by Markdown's relatively restrictive format.  It is my hope that this final digital literacy narrative itself demonstrates a far more competent usage of html.
		</p>

			<h1> Artifact 2 </h1>
<p>
			My second artifact is an adapted piece from a class which can be accessed by <a href=https://lvertal.github.io/artifacttwo/>clicking on these words.</a>

			It should be noted that this artifact is one of the pieces in which I still struggled with the software shown in class. I created a static site using the command line and MkDocs but I was unable to generate a site that appeared the way I wanted it to.  Nonetheless, I think that the content itself carries important accessibility information.
